    <h1>about me</h1>
    <br>
    <h6>Hi! My name is Vivian Dai. I'm currently a senior at Cornell University,
      where I study computer science. My interests lie in computational sustainability:
      using software, mathematics, and data to make informed decisions
      about problems impacting the earth's future.
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>After graduation, I will be starting as a software engineer on Google Cloud AI.
      I'll also be moving to Seattle. Although I've never been there before, I am
      excited to experience all of the hikes, nature, and rainy days!
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>I grew up in Toronto and it is still my favourite city to this day.</h6>
    <h6>
      Apart from computer science, I'm also studying english (as a minor), and
      horticulture (for fun). I love creative writing, especially memoir. While
      I have not published any works, I love to talk about the writing of others.
      I hope that one day, I will write a story that I want to show the world.
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>I'm an avid hiker as well. Some of the beautiful places that I have had
      the privilege to hike are Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, Pinnacles, Sequoia, Shenandoah, Huang Shan,
      Hua Shan, and Northern Ontario (and many more!). The next place on my bucket list is Zhangjiajie.

          This project taught me how to be independent and become an expert on
          a technology that my team did not have experience with. I had to learn,
          explore, and pitch new concepts, which was hardâ€”but I learned a lot.</h2>

          are implemented and used in industry. As an extension of my project,

          capabilities of hotel partners who previously could not see the data they sent.
          Not only did I learn C++ and full-stack development, but I also learned
          a lot about the software engineering industry.
