    <h1>about me</h1>
    <br>
    <h6>Hi! My name is Vivian Dai. I'm currently a <span class="highlight">senior at
        Cornell
        University</span>,
      where I study <span class="highlight">computer science</span>. My interests lie in <span
        class="highlight">computational
        sustainability</span>:
      using software, mathematics, and data to make informed decisions
      about problems impacting the earth's future.
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>After graduation, I will be starting as a <span class="highlight">software engineer on Google Cloud AI </span>.
      I'll also be moving to Seattle. Although I've never been there before, I am
      excited to experience all of the hikes, nature, and rainy days! I grew up in Toronto (which is still my favourite
      city to this day).
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>
      Apart from computer science, I'm also studying <span class="highlight">english</span> (as a
      minor), and
      <span class="highlight">horticulture</span> (for fun). I love creative writing, especially memoir.
      While
      I have not published any works, I love to talk about the writing of others.
      I hope that one day, I will write a story that I want to show the world.
    </h6>
    <br>
    <h6>I'm an <span class="highlight">avid hiker</span> as well. Some of the beautiful places that I
      have had
      the privilege to hike are Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, Pinnacles, Sequoia, Shenandoah, Huang Shan,
      Hua Shan, and Northern Ontario (and many more!). The next place on my bucket list is Zhangjiajie.

          created data pipelines to demonstrate the improved modeling workflow.
          This project taught me how to be independent and become an expert on

          explore, and pitch new concepts, which was hardâ€”but I learned a lot.</h2>
